# Falcon Accelerated Genomics Pipelines
The Falcon Accelerated Genomics Pipelines (FAGP) comprising the fcs-genome
software allows for variant calling for both germline and somatic mutations
based on the GATK Best Practices pipelines. The performance of the pipelines is
significantly improved with Falcon's acceleration technologies.

Symmetric to the GATK Best Practices pipelines, the typical workflow starts with
raw FASTQ sequence paired-end reads and proceeds to obtain a filtered set of
variants that can be annotated for further analysis.
